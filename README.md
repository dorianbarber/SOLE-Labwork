# SOLE-Labwork

Some statistical science work with the Society of Labor Economics Lab at Duke. 

Within the script there are two main results. The first result was creating a data table with each authors name and the number of articles they have written or coauthored. The second result was developing a box plot which shows the number of authors that have written a specific number of articles.
